2.	Story: At the beginning, the main character Hans is presented to be saving a princess called Gretel from a "monster". However, as the game will progress, it will turn out to be otherwise. The events of the game were being shown backwards to the player. It will be revealed that Hans is actually from the fututre(victorian period to be exact) trying to take gretel for herself and she was running away from him all the time to save herself. And the "monster" is actually trying to save her.
3.	Goals: Save Gretel
4.	Rules: i)Hans will move by pressing left and right arrow keys
            ii) Hans can jump by pressing Space button
            iii) He can climb vines by pressing up arrow
            iv) He can jump on enemies to defeat them like mario
            
           vi)  Hans will have save spots in forms of shrines throughout the game to respawn  once he dies to regenerate health and usable
           vii) Hans can die if he is touched by an enemy
           viii) Gretel will always move parallel to Hans on a higher platform most of the time she is in the scene
           
5.	Balanced: the main charcter is the "hero" while the "monster" is presented as the villain.
                  
6.	Adaptively: platforming and puzzles will be harder as the game progresses
7.	Chance and Skill: enemies will be randomly placed throughout the game(chance)
                      they will move towards the player at a certain speed which they need to avoid by jumping(skill)
