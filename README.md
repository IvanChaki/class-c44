2.	Story: At the beginning, the main character Hans is presented to be saving a character called Gretel. However, as the game will progress, it will turn out to be otherwise. It will be revealed that Hans is actually chasing Gretel and she was running away from him all the time to save herself.
3.	Goals: Come in contact with Gretel
4.	Rules: i)Hans will move by pressing left and right arrow keys
            ii) Hans can jump by pressing Space button
            iii) He can climb vines by pressing up arrow
            iv) He can use his sword by A(light attack) and D(heavy attack)
            v) He can throw knives by pressing S but only a select quantity
            vi)  Hans will have save spots in forms of shrines throughout the game to respawn  once he dies to regenerate health and usables
      *    vii) Hans can die if he is hit by light attacks 2 times and heavy attacks 1 times.
      *    viii) Enemies will die by 2 light attacks and 1 heavy attack
            ix)  some special enemies will require multiple hits(even heavy ones) to be defeated
            x) Gretel will always move parallel to Hans on a higher platform most of the game
            xi) The game will progressively change from a sky blue background and green platforms to red background and brown platforms
            xii) players can interact with certain npcs who will either tell about the world in a cryptic format or sell certain stuff like healing items or better weapons
 
5.	Balanced: i) earlier and weaker weapons will have much less durability and damage compared to better ones or ones found late in game
                  ii) there will be different kinds of enemies but mostly boil down to 2 categories: 
a) Light enemies: these enemies are fast but their attacks are usually weak 
b) Heavy enemies: They are slow but hit really hard
